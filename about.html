              <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-slate-300">Anubhav Choudhery is an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, pursuing a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. His academic path spans hardware fundamentals (Digital Design/VLSI, Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture),
                 software design (Distributed Systems, Compilers, Operating Systems), and advanced mathematics for AI, giving him a uniquely well-rounded technical foundation.<br><br>He has worked at the crossroads of Machine Learning and Cybersecurity with the MLOPT Research Group, exploring how AI techniques can 
                 strengthen secure systems. Professionally, Anubhav gained experience as a Cybersecurity Analyst at Culligan International, where he developed Python-based automation tools for the global security team and reported directly to the CISO.<br><br>Beyond research and industry, he has led large student 
                 engineering organizations, including Wisconsin Robotics and RoboKnights, managing teams of 40+ members while translating technical projects into business impact, sponsorships, and real-world competitions. These experiences reflect his strengths in leadership, collaboration, and execution.<br><br>Outside 
                 of academics, Anubhav is a chess player, drummer (Trinity Grade 3), and sports enthusiast who enjoys ping pong and pickleball. He’s also a fan of action and sci-fi cinema, with Mission Impossible and Star Wars topping his list. These hobbies give him balance, sharpen his problem-solving, and fuel his creative 
                 thinking.<br><br>Anubhav’s long-term goal is to continue exploring the intersection of AI, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Hardware Systems, applying cutting-edge technology to solve practical, real-world challenges.</p>
