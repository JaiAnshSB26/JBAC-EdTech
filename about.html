                <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-slate-300">Jai Ansh Singh Bindra is a developer, builder, and problem-solver studying 
                  Mathematics and Computer Science at École Polytechnique, France. His work sits at the crossroads of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering, with a focus on turning bold ideas into
                   working systems.<br><br>Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Finance are the other fields he is passionately working towards. From programming a team chess engine to deploying full-stack services,
                   Jai thrives on transforming scrappy prototypes into polished, scalable tools. He has spent time exploring various paradigms: from LLM pipelines and generative AI to high-performance Python and C++ optimization, while earlier venturing 
                   into rocketry avionics, robotics, and physics.<br><br>Alongside personal projects, Jai has also built experience through internships in machine learning, research and large-scale software engineering. At Forvis Mazars, he engineered a real-time computer vision 
                   system for facial recognition with anti-spoofing, achieving excellent accuracy across hundreds of test cases. At LTIMindtree, he contributed to the development of microservices powering India’s national tax system used by more than 22 million people, improving 
                   query response times by 30% while navigating high-stakes, production-level environments. These experiences sharpened his ability to combine theory with deployment-grade engineering.<br><br>At Polytechnique, Jai has pursued coursework ranging from compilers, algorithms, 
                   convex optimization, and computer architecture to machine learning and probability theory, strengthening the mathematical and technical foundations that underlie his projects. He has applied these skills in practice through systems like a YouTube LLM Summarizer & Questionnaire Generator, 
                   where he and Anubhav cut processing time from 45 minutes to 5 using GPU–CPU optimizations, and hybrid unsupervised learning pipelines for roommate and mentor-mentee matching, which achieved a 90% satisfaction rate among over 150 students.<br><br>Jai’s journey has been shaped by resilience, curiosity, 
                   and an entrepreneurial spirit. He has served as General Secretary of the IP Paris Racing Team, where he worked on both chassis and battery design for Formula Student competitions, as well as a Board Member of BX Quant & Finance, and President of RobotX, the robotics society of the Bachelor program. He has also 
                   co-founded student-driven initiatives in the past that pushed beyond academics into applied innovation. In 2022, his technical social-impact project Roll Infinity was featured in the Times of India, and earlier, he was selected as a member of the Junior Academy at the New York Academy of Sciences, a global recognition of his early curiosity 
                   and drive.<br><br>Outside of tech, Jai is a speedcubing enthusiast who has mastered more than 25 puzzle types, a badminton player, and someone who enjoys linguistics, geopolitics, and exploring new languages. His long-term vision is to bridge AI, mathematics, and finance—designing systems that are as precise as they are impactful.<br><br>Above all, 
                   Jai is defined by his ability to lead under pressure, turn setbacks into momentum, and keep pushing boundaries. Whether in exploring quant trading, applied AI, or building the next wave of student tools, he works with the mindset of a builder who refuses to settle for average.</p>

              Anubhav Choudhery is an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, pursuing a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. His academic path bridges hardware fundamentals (Digital Design/VLSI, Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture), 
              software design (Distributed Systems, Compilers, Operating Systems), and advanced mathematics for AI — giving him a uniquely well-rounded technical foundation.<br><br>
  
              He has explored the intersection of Machine Learning and Cybersecurity through research with the MLOPT Research Group, investigating how AI can enhance the robustness of secure systems. Professionally, Anubhav gained industry experience as a 
              Cybersecurity Analyst at Culligan International, where he developed Python-based automation tools for the global security team and reported directly to the CISO. These experiences sharpened his skills in building practical systems that operate reliably under real-world constraints.<br><br>

  Beyond research and internships, Anubhav has played a central role in student-led engineering organizations. As a leader of Wisconsin Robotics and RoboKnights, he managed teams of 40+ members, driving both technical innovation and external partnerships. His work translated
  complex technical projects into competition-ready systems and sustainable organizations — a reflection of his strengths in leadership, collaboration, and execution.<br><br>

  Anubhav has also collaborated on projects that blend AI with applied problem-solving. Together with Jai, he co-developed the YouTube LLM Summarizer & Questionnaire Generator, optimizing it from 45-minute runtimes to under 5 minutes through GPU–CPU acceleration, and building a pipeline capable of transforming video content into summaries and active-recall questionnaires.
  This project, alongside their joint work on the AI-Interviewer and Hackathon Scraper, highlights his ability to push prototypes into usable tools.<br><br>

  Outside academics and projects, Anubhav is a chess player, a drummer (Trinity Grade 3), and a sports enthusiast who enjoys ping pong and pickleball. He’s also a fan of action and sci-fi cinema, with <i>Mission Impossible</i> and <i>Star Wars</i> topping his list. These activities give him balance, sharpen his problem-solving skills, and fuel his creative thinking.<br><br>

  Anubhav’s long-term goal is to continue exploring the intersection of AI, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Hardware Systems, applying cutting-edge technology to solve practical, high-impact challenges across industries, while continuing to grow as a leader and innovator.
