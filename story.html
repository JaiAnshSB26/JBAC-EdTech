    <!-- STORY / TIMELINE -->
    <section class="py-20">
      <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
        <h1 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-black">The JBAC story</h1>
        <p class="mt-2 max-w-prose text-slate-300">"The greatest feeling in this world is not love, it's obsession."</p>

        <div class="mt-10 space-y-6 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            For us, that obsession has always been about making things work. JBAC started as two friends on opposite sides of a
            <span class="whitespace-nowrap">7-hour</span> time difference, trading late-night calls and stubborn promises: if something was broken, we would fix it; if something didn’t exist, we would build it. There were versioning disasters at 3 a.m., free-tier limits that killed deploys mid-demo, and cryptic logs that made us question our logic. We messed things up, rolled them back, and tried again. What never left was the rush—the obsession—with solving problems and shipping something real.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every project began the same way: a gap we felt in our own lives, a quick “can we build this?” on a call, and then days of reading docs, tracing stack traces, and rewriting parts that didn’t scale. The terminal-only AI-Interviewer became a voice-to-voice service. The Hackathon Scraper grew from a local script to a clean, hosted tool. The YouTube LLM Questionnaire Generator went from a 45-minute pipeline to a <span class="whitespace-nowrap">5–7</span> minute sprint through careful GPU–CPU optimization. We did it the unglamorous way—RTFM, unit tests, logging, refactors, and a lot of coffee.
          </p>

          <p>
            We learned deployment the hard way. Free tiers meant budgets and trade-offs; cold starts forced us to rethink architecture; rate limits taught us to cache, queue, and backoff. We broke things minutes before demos and fixed them minutes after. We fought merge conflicts, dependency hell, and “works on my machine” until it worked on everyone’s. The point was never perfection—it was persistence. Keep moving. Keep shipping.
          </p>

          <p>
            JBAC isn’t a pitch deck. It’s a rhythm: build → break → learn → ship. Our ideas came from the simple feeling that something should exist, and if it didn’t, we’d make it—and open-source it so others could use it too. We tried to keep everything free-tier friendly, documented the sharp edges, and made the UX fast so people actually saved time. What started as phone calls turned into products, and those products turned into a habit: take small, useful ideas and push them into the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s the story we believe in. Not luck. Not shortcuts. Just two friends who got stubborn enough that no amount of errors, logs, or rate limits could break us. JBAC is our obsession with building—one commit, one fix, one shipped tool at a time.
